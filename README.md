Project Title: ATM Fraud Detection & Prevention

Short Description:

The ATM Fraud project aims to identify, analyze, and prevent fraudulent activities that target users of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). 
These frauds include card skimming, where criminals attach devices to steal card data and PINs; shimming, which exploits chip-based cards using thin inserts; card trapping where the fraudster
retains the user’s card in the ATM; and phishing or social engineering schemes that trick customers into sharing sensitive banking information.
The project involves studying how these frauds work, detecting fraudulent behavior in real-time, and implementing safeguards — both technological 
(e.g. device detection, monitoring, encrypted communications) and procedural (user awareness,
ATM physical inspections, bank policies) — to protect customers and financial institutions.
